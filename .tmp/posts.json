This has profound implications for the future of work and creativity.\n\n```python\n# Example of using a pseudo-AI library\nfrom awesome_ai import Generator\n\ntext_generator = Generator(model=\"super-creative-v1\")\ngenerated_text = text_generator.prompt(\"Write a poem about robots.\")\nprint(generated_text)\n```\n\nThe potential is limitless, but it also raises important ethical questions that we must address as a society.\n    "
